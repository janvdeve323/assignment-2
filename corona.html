<h1>COVID-19 and Mental health</h1>
<p>
In the recent past the fear of spreading virus covid-19 rised with rapid pace.<br>
The virus targetted to all communities of people,yeah it is unbias to all be it a rich person like Ambani ,middle class person or poor people.<br>
The virus brought changes to our daily lives,the changes would have been positive and negative to different people.<br>
covid brought the best out of me,I being an ex-covid patient got the chance to introspect my skills and strength.<br>
Although the virus was more of a nightmare but it taught me about my strength,it taught me how to stay positive mentally  when i was actually, <br>
positive with the virus.<br>
I never stopped dreaming about my future,i never gave up on my studies,I never restrained myself from listening to music ,i used to put on my headphone,feel the music and feel the life inside me.<br>
WE should always think that covid -19 is just a virus that was created by humans accidently it cannot control humans ,unless we allow it to do so.<br>
Best part of covid-Each and every school ,colleges and offices were closed down amidst the covid.<br>
People who were earlier so busy in their lives got the opportunity to stay close to their family .Parents helped out childrens with their studies.<br>
This filled the lacuna between parents and childrens.<br>

At last i would like to share the most awaiting thought from one of my secret dairy:<br></p>
           <p class="b">"If you're passionate ,<br>
		   don't restrain yourself from spilling all that you are".<br>
		   Your dedication and strength is more powerful than a petty virus.<br>
